# hns-dns

This script simply helps you set your resolution up if you have hsd running on Mac (or with Bob) on port 5350.  This sets up a port forward and sets your dns server to 127.0.0.1

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/realrasengan/hns-dns
cd hns-dns
```

## Usage
Turn on 127.0.0.1 resolution (must have hsd on 5350 or Bob running)
```
node setdns.js on
```
Turn off (set to 1.1.1.1)
```
node setdns.js off
```
